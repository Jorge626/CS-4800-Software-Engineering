# CS-4800-Software-Engineering
A project I created with a group of other students in my CS 4800 Software Engineering course

In this project, we developed a web grocery delivery service called InstaBasket utilizing HTML5, Bootstrap, Django, MySQL, and Heroku to host our website. A link to the website can be found [here](http://fierce-lowlands-94520.herokuapp.com/).
